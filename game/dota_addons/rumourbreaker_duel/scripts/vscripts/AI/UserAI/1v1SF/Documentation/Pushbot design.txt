General description:
The design for the 1v1 push bot is to try to push down the enemy tower as quickly as possible.
The bot ignores the enemy hero and just autoattacks the creeps in the lane. 

State-based design:
When the bot's hero gets to a certain HP threshold it will return to base to regen and buy items.
Once the hero's HP is full it will return back to lane. When a hero dies it will also go to its
shopping state. Pushing contains another state machine to prevent tanking enemy creeps.

A formal description of the statespace can be found in 'Pushbot statespace.png'

State implementation:
The buying state will be implemented by adding a decision tree in combination with a list of
desired items, which the bot will just try to purchase one by one if it has the money. The
attacking creeps or tower state also consists of a decision tree to determine what to do.
The implementation of the other states is trivial.
